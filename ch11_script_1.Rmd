# Class One Start

### Scene 1

**Prompt:** Explore the county level data from [here](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/county-level-data-sets/download-data/) with your partner and try to figure out the variables mean. Can you find any "interesting" observations? Which variables are worth looking at? `poverty` is the percentage of the county living in poverty is 2018. `less_than_hs` is the percentage of the county without at least a high school diploma. `hs` is the percent of the county who have a high school degree, but no further education.

```{r scene 1, echo=FALSE}
glimpse(county)

sample_n(county, size = 10, replace = FALSE)

summary(county)

county %>% 
  select(name, poverty, hs)
```


# Scene 2

**Prompt** Let’s start by exploring our numerical outcome variable `poverty` and our numerical explanatory variable `less_than_hs`. What is the average poverty rate in the US? How does this compare with that of your county (if not from US look up Middlesex County - the county that Cambridge, MA is in)? Furthermore, what is the average percentage of adults without and with a high school diploma? Which state's county has the highest percentage of adults without a high school diploma?

```{r scene 2, echo=FALSE}

county %>%
  summarize(avgPovery = mean(poverty))

county %>%
  filter(name == "New Hanover County") %>%
  pull(poverty)

county %>%
  summarize(without_hs = mean(less_than_hs,),
            with_hs = mean(hs))

county %>%
  arrange(desc(less_than_hs)) %>%
  select(state, name, less_than_hs)
```


# Scene 3

**Prompt** What is the correlation coefficient of `poverty` and `less_than_hs`? What does it mean?

```{r scene 3, echo=FALSE}

county %>% 
  summarize(correlation = cor(poverty, less_than_hs))

```

# Scene 3a:

**Prompt** Assume we are trying to understand the causes of poverty. Chapter 11 discusses two types of models: explanatory and predictive. Which kind is this? Is this a causal relationship? Discuss this in the context of the Rubin Causal Model and potential outcomes.

==> EXPLANATORY

note: models do not exist independent of someone's motivations

alt prompt: given the rate of less_than_hs for an county, what is the likely poverty rate? ==> PREDICTIVE

# Scene 3B

**Prompt** Assume we want to create an explanatory model. Create a new variable, `good_education`, which is 1 if `less_than_hs`is less than 13 and 0 if it is not. Discuss this in the context of the Rubin Causal Model and potential outcomes. Write down the units, the treatments, and the outcomes. Define the causal effect of `good_education` on poverty rate.

```{r scene 3b, echo=FALSE}
county %>% 
  mutate(good_education = ifelse(less_than_hs < 13, 1, 0)) %>%
  summarize(correlation = cor(less_than_hs, good_education))

```

units: individual counties
treatment: send more than 13% of population to high school
outcomes: 

# Scene 4

**Prompt** Use a scatterplot to visualize this data, including a straight line of best fit.

```{r scene 4, echo=FALSE}

revised <- county %>%
  mutate(less_than_hs_2 = less_than_hs/100)

lm(poverty ~ less_than_hs, county)
lm(poverty ~ less_than_hs_2, revised)

revised %>%
  summarize(correlation = cor(poverty, less_than_hs_2))

graph <- ggplot(county, aes(x = less_than_hs, y = poverty)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = "Percent of adults with less than a high school diploma",
       y = "Poverty rate",
       title = "Relationship between Poverty Rate and High School Education",
       subtle = "One data point per county")

graph

# review difference between correlation coefficient and slope
```

# Scene 5

**Prompt** Create an animation of the scatterplot above with the percent of adults with less than a high school diploma on the x axis and the poverty rate in the y axis. This scatterplot should transition through the four US regions. Hint: classify the 'county' data into the 4 US regions. Then create an animation of a scatterplot that transitions through each region. Hint: Read the [Animation appendix](https://davidkane9.github.io/PPBDS/C-animation.html) of the *[Primer](https://davidkane9.github.io/PPBDS/)*. You only need to add one command to the basic static `ggplot()` call.

```{r scene 5, echo=FALSE}

ggplot(county, aes(x = less_than_hs,
                   y = poverty,
                   fill = region,
                   color = region)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Percent of adults with less than a high school diploma",
       y = "Poverty rate",
       title = "Relationship between Poverty Rate and High School Education",
       subtle = "One data point per county") +
    transition_manual(region)


```


# Scene 6

**Prompt** Using the `lm()` function, fit a model with this data in which `poverty` is the dependent variable and `less_than_hs` is the independent variable. Save the resulting object as `poverty_model`. Then, use the tidy() function found in section 11.1.2 to obtain the regression parameters. You should have a 2x7 regression table with terms of (Intercept) and `less_than_hs`, as well as an estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value, conf.low, and conf.high. Write one sentence explaining what the intercept means and one sentence about what the slope means.


# Scene 7

**Prompt** Use nest() to create a bootstrap sample of the linear regression. In this dataset, we'll have a resampled collection of counties in which we’ll sometimes have multiple counties represented and sometimes there won’t be any from our original 'county' data.


# Scene 8 

**Prompt**  Now, using the starter code above, go ahead and add more columns. Make one called `mod` which will contains the model objects created by `lm()`. Then, add one called `reg_results` which will tidy the objects created by `lm()`, and then one called `disp_coef` which will display the regression coefficient for each bootstrap sample. 


# Scene 9 

**Prompt** Create a confidence interval of the slope of our linear regression. What is the value at the 50th percentile? Is that expected? Provide a Bayesian and Frequentist interpretation of this interval.


# Scene 10 

**Prompt** Now, let's use a shortcut. Use the confidence intervals reported by `lm()` and `tidy()`.

# Scene 11

**Prompt** Alas, our data is missing Travis County in Texas. Suppose Travis County has 10.9% of adults with less than a high school degree. What do you think its poverty rate would be? Why? 

# Scene 12

**Prompt** Suppose I tell you now that Travis County has a 12% poverty rate. By how much was your estimate off? Why?

# Scene 13

**Prompt** Now, compute the fitted and residual values for each county. Explain what the following columns mean in one sentence each: poverty, pct_less_hs, .fitted, .resid. What does it mean to have a positive residual?


# Scene 14

**Prompt** Find the largest positive residual and largest negative residual. Why do you think there is such a large discrepancy?


# Scene 15

**Prompt** Go back and read the first part of Chapter 11 in the *Primer*. Are we modeling for explanation or for prediction? How do you know?


# Challenge Problems

# Scene 1

**Prompt** Find the standard error of the fitted values, and then construct a confidence interval. Remember, a 95% confidence interval can be found by adding/subtracting 1.96 * SE to the mean. Why is the uncertainty for particular predictions higher than the uncertainty for our estimate of the coefficient on less_than_hs?


# Scene 2

**Prompt** Take a look at the babynames library. Replicate the animation below exactly!
